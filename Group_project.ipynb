    "By using the K-nearest neighbor algorithm, we can determine the class of new data inputs in an existing data set. The K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve classification problems. KNN works by finding a pre-determined number of points with the nearest distance to a new data point.  From these points, the majority class will classify the new point as such. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some work must be done on the data set before using KNN to classify is possible. This includes centering and scaling the data, splitting the data set into training and testing points, and using the training set to build a classification model. From this model, the K Nearest Neighbor algorithm will be used to answer a predictive question pertaining to our data set, using existing attributes in the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The predictive question we will be using classification to answer is: based on the degree of study time, and the exam performance of a student, what is the predicted knowledge level of the student on the subject?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the UCI User Knowledge Modeling Data set to answer this question. The data set contains information about the student's knowledge status about the subject of Electrical DC Machines. This is a multivariate data set which includes 5 attributes, all of which are integer values. There are 403 instances in this data set. The attributes we will be using in our classification model are: The degree of study time for goal object materials, The exam performance of user for goal objects, The knowledge level of user.\n",
    "\n",
    "By building a model based on the existing attributes in the data set, we will be able to answer a predictive question on the expected knowledge level of a student on the subject. "

    "Expected outcomes and significance:\n",
    "What do you expect to find?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be predicting the knowledge level of a user based on the degree of study time, and exam performance of a student. We expect to find that higher study time and higher exam performance will correspond to a higher level of knowledge of the student. \n",
    "\n",
    "What impact could such findings have?\n",
    "\n",
    "Such findings could help inform students of more valuable and efficient study techniques to achieve the maximum level of knowledge for a subject. In addition, it could help students, teachers and course coordinators be able to make valuable predictions on the knowledge level students achieved when completing a course by assessing different these attributes which could be collected throughout the course. By analyzing the study time and test performance, predictions could be made on how well the course material was retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "What future questions could this lead to?\n",
    "\n",
    "This could lead to future questions such as, Could we predict which attribute has a more significant impact on the level of knowledge of students to inform students which area was more valuable to focus on, and leads to success more than others? Another question we could explore is does the knowledge level of the student have a relationship with time, for example, does it begin to decrease a certain amount of time after the course has been completed?\n"
